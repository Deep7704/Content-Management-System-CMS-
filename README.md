# Content-Management-System-CMS-
This project is a custom-built Content Management System (CMS) developed using Angular 19 (Frontend), ASP.NET Core 8 (Backend API), and PostgreSQL (Database). The primary goal behind creating this CMS is to offer a fully dynamic and user-driven web content platform that enables authenticated users to manage and update website content without direct code changes.

The application supports real-time editing, file uploads, and dynamic page management, making it ideal for blogs, business websites and admin dashboards. The project supports RABC mode which containes 3 major roles Admin,Editor,User. It features modular content editing (About, Gallery, Careers, etc.), user authentication, image and video management, and resume upload capabilities â€” all integrated with a robust backend and secure data layer.

This project demonstrates my ability to build a full-stack dynamic web application with a scalable and maintainable architecture, and it serves as a showcase of my skills in modern frontend development, REST API design, and database integration.
